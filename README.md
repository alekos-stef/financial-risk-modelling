# financial-risk-modelling
R scripts for two projects in quantitative risk management.
[1] Extreme Value Model: Construction of the block-maxima, goodness-of-fit test, parameter estimation for the GEV distribution using the block maxima, parameter estimation for the GPD using POT (Peaks Over Threshold), estimation of the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES) using POT and their empirical estimators.
[2] Investment Portfolio Risk: Estimation of the expected portfolio performance, estimation of the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES) for given synthesis, portfolio optimization, estimation of the beta coefficients and the variance-covariance matrix, estimation of the VaR, ES and the expected performance using the beta coefficients.
